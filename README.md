## 📝 Thesis Abstract
> With the growth of the computer science industry, a fundamental introduction to the topic was needed at the middle school level. This research investigated the effectiveness of fun and engaging game design within an educational space. Additionally, inequity within the industry as well as the impact of earlier education on industry growth had to be examined. The outcome of this research was creating a computer science game meant to educate middle school students. This subsequently involved creating a game that was both fun and educational, addressing elements of gender disparity within game design, and implementing a game design that catered to everyone. Wizardry Academy is a 3D open-world adventure game where students play through levels modelled after early computer science concepts. The designed game is inclusive, while providing an opportunity for students to discover an interest in computer science. Advancement of the industry in terms of equity and overall growth is the delayed benefit highlighted by this study.
